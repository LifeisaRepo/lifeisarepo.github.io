Imagine you want to make a car ...ðŸ¤”. Your mind has probably started making a list of things that you would need to build a car. Now using my mystical powers of deduction I can say that the first few things that would have popped in your mind would be the **Engine/Electric Motor, Chassis, Wheels, Car Body, etc**. Certainly there are a lot more things that you need to build a car - but these are some of the extremely critical parts without which you just cannot make a car. This logic stays generally the same when developing anything (_this is clearly a segue now.._) and so it's also the same with creating an app in Unreal Engine.

Unreal Engine has a few critically important classes which have to be a part of your application and each of them has a dedicated responsibility and a dedicated scope where it works. Either you add those classes yourself or Unreal will automatically add them for you, but without them the application just **DOES NOT WORK**. In this devlog we are gonna discuss about these important classes (_I will try not to be too boring but I can't promise anything lol_) which I have listed as follows,

1. Game Mode/Game Mode Base
1. Player Controller
1. Pawn
1. Game Instance
1. Level Blueprint

#### _NOTE: See I'm not going to explain every single detail about these classes here, you can easily get that information in the Unreal docs. My goal is to just explain their general purpose in a simple way which helps you use them in the right way._

TBC...
