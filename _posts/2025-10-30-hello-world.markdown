Blogging. It's been on my mind since ages now, but I was lazy. I liked to read and I liked to write (_hence turned to writing code..._) but you just end up losing some good habits along the way. But I guess now's a good time as any to kick myself in the ass and get going.

I'm still not entirely sure whats the focus of this website, its definitely going to be a devlog sort of a website but not confined to a specific software or app as of now. Its mostly gonna be a little of everything and maybe a lot of something. Very similar to my current job role, where I end up doing anything and everything in the tech space that excites me and allows me to learn something new.

As Unreal Engine is my main muse I'm probably going to write mostly about that, but then I might write about other shit too along the way. Through my job I have delved into Sports broadcast (_both in-studio and on-field_) as well as I have dabbled quite a bit into Virtual Production and recently also hopped on the AI bandwagon. Honestly I'm not interesting in learning the technical concepts behind AI but I don't shy away from using AI tools to make my life easier and to also use in a few of my applications.

I think my brain has farted as much fart as it could fart so I guess I'm gonna end this one here. Also I guess it's quite obvious by now that I'm not going to keep my language super professional here. I will definitely try to avoid the use of profanities as much as possible - but I can't promise anything. To be clear if I wanted to to be very **"HR compliant"** then I would have just used Linkedin...

Anyways, Cheers üçª!
